            <p>
                A Hypothesis is a testable on the basis of observed data modelled as the realised values taken by a collection of random variables.
                <br>A set of data is modelled as being realised values of a collection of random variables having a joint probability distribution in some set of possible joint distributions. The hypothesis being tested is exactly that set of possible
                probability distributions.
                <br>A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference. An alternative hypothesis is proposed for the probability distribution of the data, either explicitly or only informally. The comparison of the two models is deemed
                statistically significant if, according to a threshold probability—the significance level—the data would be unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis were true.
                <br>A hypothesis test specifies which outcomes of a study may lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis at a pre-specified level of significance, while using a pre-chosen measure of deviation from that hypothesis (the test statistic,
                or goodness-of-fit measure). The pre-chosen level of significance is the maximal allowed "false positive rate". One wants to control the risk of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.

                The process of distinguishing between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is aided by considering two conceptual types of errors. The first type of error occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly rejected. The second type of error occurs
                when the null hypothesis is wrongly not rejected. (The two types are known as type 1 and type 2 errors.)
