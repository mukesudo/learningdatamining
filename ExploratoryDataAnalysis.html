                In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is
                for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could
                lead to new data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA), which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making
                transformations of variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA.

            <h3>Technique</h3>
            <p>
                Most EDA techniques are graphical in nature with a few quantitative techniques. The reason for the heavy reliance on graphics is that by its very nature the main role of EDA is to open-mindedly explore, and graphics gives the analysts unparalleled power
                to do so, enticing the data to reveal its structural secrets, and being always ready to gain some new, often unsuspected, insight into the data. In combination with the natural pattern-recognition capabilities that we all possess, graphics
                provides, of course, unparalleled power to carry this out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The particular graphical techniques employed in EDA are often quite simple, consisting of various techniques of:

                <li>Plotting the raw data (such as data traces, histograms, bihistograms, probability plots, lag plots, block plots, and Youden plots.</li>
                <li>Plotting simple statistics such as mean plots, standard deviation plots, box plots, and main effects plots of the raw data.</li>
                <li>Positioning such plots so as to maximize our natural pattern-recognition abilities, such as using multiple plots per page.</li>
