                In statistics, the coefficient of multiple correlation is a measure of how well a given variable can be predicted using a linear function of a set of other variables. It is the correlation between the variable's values and the best predictions that can
                be computed linearly from the predictive variables.
                <br> The coefficient of multiple correlation takes values between .00 and 1.00; a higher value indicates a high predictability of the dependent variable from the independent variables, with a value of 1 indicating that the predictions
                are exactly correct and a value of 0 indicating that no linear combination of the independent variables is a better predictor than is the fixed mean of the dependent variable.<br> The coefficient of multiple correlation is known as the
                square root of the coefficient of determination, but under the particular assumptions that an intercept is included and that the best possible linear predictors are used, whereas the coefficient of determination is defined for more general
                cases, including those of nonlinear prediction and those in which the predicted values have not been derived from a model-fitting procedure.

            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>
                The coefficient of multiple correlation, denoted R, is a scalar that is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and the actual values of the dependent variable in a linear regression model that includes an intercept.
            </p>
            <h3>Computation</h3>
            <p>
                The square of the coefficient of multiple correlation can be computed using the vector {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} ={(r_{x_{1}y},r_{x_{2}y},\dots ,r_{x_{N}y})}^{\top }}\mathbf {c} ={(r_{x_{1}y},r_{x_{2}y},\dots ,r_{x_{N}y})}^{\top } of correlations {\displaystyle
                r_{x_{n}y}}r_{x_{n}y} between the predictor variables {\displaystyle x_{n}}x_{n} (independent variables) and the target variable {\displaystyle y}y (dependent variable), and the correlation matrix {\displaystyle R_{xx}}R_{{xx}} of correlations
                between predictor variables. It is given by

            </p>
            <p>
                where {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} ^{\top }}\mathbf {c} ^{\top } is the transpose of {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} }\mathbf {c} , and {\displaystyle R_{xx}^{-1}}R_{{xx}}^{{-1}} is the inverse of the matrix
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="multi corelation data2.JPG" alt="multi correlation matrix">
            </p>
            <p>
                If all the predictor variables are uncorrelated, the matrix {\displaystyle R_{xx}}R_{{xx}} is the identity matrix and {\displaystyle R^{2}}R^{2} simply equals {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} ^{\top }\,\mathbf {c} }\mathbf {c} ^{\top }\,\mathbf {c} , the sum
                of the squared correlations with the dependent variable. If the predictor variables are correlated among themselves, the inverse of the correlation matrix {\displaystyle R_{xx}}R_{{xx}} accounts for this.
            </p>

            <p>
                The squared coefficient of multiple correlation can also be computed as the fraction of variance of the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables, which in turn is 1 minus the unexplained fraction. The unexplained fraction can
                be computed as the sum of squared residuals—that is, the sum of the squares of the prediction errors—divided by the sum of the squared deviations of the values of the dependent variable from its expected value.
